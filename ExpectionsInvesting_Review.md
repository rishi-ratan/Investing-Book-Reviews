# Expectations Investing Summary
## Key Shifts in the market since 2001
- **Shift from *active to passive* investing**: Index funds and ETFs are the prominent investment asset classes rather than stock picking. 
- **Rise of intangible investments**: Companies today invest substantially more in intangible assets because they appear on the income statement as an *expense*, while tangible investments are recorded as assets on the balance sheet. 
- **Shift from Public to Private Equity**: There are ~1/3 fewer public companies listed in the US today compared to 2001. VC an PE have become the new preferred asset classes for investors and operators are staying private longer to avoid scrutiny endured in the public markets. 
- **Changes in Accounting Rules**: In the 1990s, stock-based compensation (SBC) consisted primarily of employee stock options (ESOPs) that were *not* expensed on the income statement. Today, SBC is primarily in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) that are expensed on the income statement. Therefore, both the form of renumeration and how it is accounted for have changed. Furthermore, the accounting rules for M&A have revised *ending* the pooling-of-interests method and *eliminating* goodwill amortization. 

## Chapter 1: Case for Expectations Investing
Stock prices are the **clearest** and most **reliable** signal of the market's expectations about a company's future financial performance. 
> The key to successful investing is to estimate the level of expected performance embedded in the current stock price and then assess the likelihood of a revision in expectations. 

**Growth money manager** looks for well-managed companies with *rapid earnings growth* that trade at **reasonable** *price-to-earnings (P/E)* multiples. Bet here is on the company's future growth prospects. 

**Value manager** extols the virtues of buying quality companies at **low** price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples. Bet here is that the market is underestimating the company's intrinsic worth. 

Short-term earnings are not very helpful for gauging expectations because they are a **poor proxy** for how the market values stocks. 

> Ability to properly read market expectations and anticipate revisions of these expectations is the springboard for earning super long-term results. Stock prices express the collective expectations of investors, and changes in those expectations determine investment success. 

> Expectations investing ias a stock-selection process that uses the market's own pricing mechanism, the discounted-cash-flow (DCF) model, with an important twist: Rather than forecast cash flows, expectations investing starts by reading the expectations implied by a company's current stock price. 

~2/3 of the active managers who run hedge funds consisting of large-capitalization (large-cap) stocks **lag behind** the S&P500 index in an average year, and close to 90% underperform over a 10 year period. 

Investment performance is a **zero-sum** game before **fees** because the gains of investors who beat the market are offset by the losses of investors who underperform the market. 
>The standard deviation of excess returns, which measures the difference between the results of the best and worst managers, has narrowed since the 1970s.

The asset-weighted expense ratio for actively managed US equity mutual funds averages **0.68%** of the asset value. In contrast, the equivalent expense ratio for passive funds is **0.09%** of the asset value. 

> The inability to sustain pain in the short term can affect the opportunity to achieve superior gains in the long-term.

### Expectations Investing Process
**Step 1 -  Estimate Price-Implied Expectations**: Long-term DCF model is the right tool to read expectations because it mirrors the way the market prices stocks. 

**Step 2 - Identify Expectations Opportunities**: Determine whether the stock price is most sensitive to revisions in the company's sales, operating costs, or investment needs. 

**Step 3 - Buy, Sell, Hold?**: Prospective buys must offer clear-cut "margin of safety," a sufficient discount to expected value so as to compensate for the potential of analytical mistakes or bad luck. Similarly, a sell candidate must trade at a sufficient premium to its expected value. 

### Three pervasive misconceptions in Traditional Investing
**Market takes a short-term view**: Market doesn't react mechanically to short-term reported earnings, instead it uses unexpected earnings results, and increasingly management's guidance about future earnings, as a *signal to revise* expectations for a company's future cash flows when appropriate. If the market interprets dissapointing earnings or guidance as a sign of a downturn over the long-term, it sends the stock price lower and vice-versa. 
> Shareholders of a company with a stock price that fully anticipates its performance should expect to earn a market-required rate of return. Investors need to extend expected cash flows over many years (often above >10) to justift stock prices. 

**Earnings per share (EPS) dictate value**: Earnings exclude (1) a charge for the cost of capital, (2) the incremental investments in working capital and fixed capital needed to support a company's growth, and (3) earnings calculations ignore the opportunity cost and time-value-of-money. 
> When a company invests in a project, it must compare its return to those of alternative, equally risky investment opportunities. This opportunity cost, or cost of capital, is the discount rate for the discounted cash flow model. 

> Earnings don't recognize the cash outflows for investments in future growth, such as increases in accounts receivables, inventory, and fixed assets. 

> DCF models, in contrast, incorporate all cahs inflows and outflows. 

> Revenue recognition and matching expenses with revenue are thr two fundamental steps that determine earnings. 

**Price-earnings multiples determine value**: Investment community's favorite metric that measures what investors will pay for a stock. 
> Shareholder value per share = EPS x P/

Investors typically know last year's EPS or next year's consensus EPS estimate, they typically only need to estimate the appropriate P/E multiple. But since E (earnings) are also known, the only unknown is P (price). Thus, there is a tautology: to estimate value, you need an estimate of value. 

> P/E multiple does not determine value but rather derives from value. Price-earnings analysis is snot an analytical shortcut. Its an economic cul-de-sac.
